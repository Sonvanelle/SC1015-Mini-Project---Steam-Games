## Problem and Motivation
PC games sold via [Steam] makes up 75% of the PC game  market share. In 2017 alone, there were [$4.3B worth of sales].
The PC gaming industry is expected to grow to [$256.97 billion by 2025].
Therefore, how can we use data science to determine what games can be financially successuful on the PC market?



## Tools and Models used
- [Seaborn] & [Plotly]
- [Pandas] & [Scikit-Learn]
- Agglomerative Heirarchical Clustering
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- Hyperparameter Tuning and K-Fold Cross-Validation

The iPython Notebook was collaboratively worked on using [Deepnote].
