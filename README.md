## Problem and Motivation
PC games sold via [Steam] makes up 75% of the PC game  market share. In 2017 alone, there were [$4.3B worth of sales].
The PC gaming industry is expected to grow to [$256.97 billion by 2025].
Therefore, how can we use data science to determine what games can be financially successuful on the PC market?



## Tools and Models used
- [Seaborn] & [Plotly]
- [Pandas] & [Scikit-Learn]
- Agglomerative Heirarchical Clustering
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- Hyperparameter Tuning and K-Fold Cross-Validation

The iPython Notebook was collaboratively worked on using [Deepnote].

## Process and Conclusion
- Genre & category are insufficient to predict a game's average playtime.
- Overall, game genre tags found on each Steam store page only have small correlations to playtime, at best.
- Clustering helps to group and 'focus down' the many possible combinations of genre tags, which improved our analysis.
- It can be observed via exploratory analysis that there is a positive correlation between the number of reviews, number of owners, and price on average playtime, more so than individual genres.
- Owners & overall_reviews have a higher correlation, and thus can better predict a game's average playtime.
- Developers should focus on ensuring their game is accessible, e.g. cheap/affordable, cross_platform, and popular via marketing and high percieved quality, rather than trying to target a genre segment.

## Key Takeaways
- Handling large and imbalanced datasets, how to identify and retain useful data.
- Different prediction models, such as Gradient Boosting to continuously improve model accuracy.
- Enhancing data visualisation and comprehension using Heirarchical Clustering.
- Using Scipy spatial distance and Scikit-Learn clustering to generate a dendrogram.
